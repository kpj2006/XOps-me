## 2. Chain registry — `src/drivers/chains.ts`

> Implemented as a TypeScript module, not `assets/chains.json`: it is one entry, and a JSON
> import would need a bundler assertion for nothing. It lives under `src/drivers/` because
> that is the only place I1 permits a chain id or a hex address to be written down. `main.ts`
> does the lookup and hands plain strings down, so core and the adapters still learn nothing.

**Ethereum Sepolia is the only network implemented until v1.0.0.** Everything in §2.3 is
reference material for later phases — do not add those entries to `chains.json` yet.

### 2.1 Ethereum Sepolia — the only active target

Changed from Base Sepolia on 2026-09-05. Reason: the Safe **AllowanceModule** is canonically
deployed on Ethereum Sepolia and **absent from Base Sepolia entirely**. Under the allowance
model the module is load-bearing. See `DECISION-LOG.md` §4 and §6c.

```jsonc
{
  "eip155:11155111": {
    "name": "Ethereum Sepolia",
    "chainId": 11155111,
    "explorer": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io",
    "allowanceModule": "0xCFbFaC74C26F8647cBDb8c5caf80BB5b32E43134", // v0.1.0, verified
    "assets": {
      "USDC": {
        "address": "TODO — verify against Circle's docs before use",
        "decimals": 6
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **The USDC address is deliberately unfilled.** Get it from `faucet.circle.com` /
> Circle's contract documentation for Ethereum Sepolia and confirm `decimals()` on-chain.
> It was not verified in the session that produced this entry, and a guessed token address is
> worse than an empty one.

> **The `facilitator` and `eip712` fields are gone on purpose.** Both belonged to the x402 /
> EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` design. Under the allowance model there is no facilitator
> and no typed-data signature to build, so there is no EIP-712 domain to get wrong. The
> AllowanceModule address replaces them as the load-bearing constant.

**Why this chain:** `x402.org/facilitator` is free, keyless, and the URL used in the official
quickstart. Testnet USDC comes from `faucet.circle.com`; gas from the Alchemy, GetBlock, or CDP
faucets. Nearly every x402 tutorial and starter kit defaults here, so a working reference always
exists. Base carries ~85% of x402 mainnet volume, which makes it the right eventual production
target too. No known SDK version sensitivity.

### 2.2 Proving the layer boundary without a second chain

The layer boundary (I1) needs *evidence*, and the obvious evidence — "adding a network touched
zero core files" — normally requires two networks. It doesn't have to.

**Register a `mock/test` driver in the test suite instead.** It implements `SettlementDriver`
against an in-memory ledger, declares `nativeReplayProtection: true`, and settles instantly with
no network. It proves the same three things a second chain would:

- the registry resolves `(scheme × network)` without core changes
- `Intent` → `PaymentRequirements` → `PaymentPayload` carries no EVM assumptions
- the engine runs end-to-end against a driver that has never heard of `keccak256`

It is also strictly better as evidence: it runs offline, in CI, forever, on every push — and it
costs no faucet, no RPC, and no second set of constants to keep current. Ship it in
`test/drivers/mock/`, and put the "adding a driver touches zero core files" diff in the README.

### 2.3 Later phases — reference only, do not implement

Each step tests exactly one new thing. Do not skip a rung.

| Phase | Target | What it newly proves | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Base Sepolia | the whole system | ← you are here |
| 2 | Base mainnet | real money, real gas | same driver, config change only; **`eip712.name` may differ — re-verify** |
| 3 | Monad | second EVM chain | verified constants below |
| 4 | Solana / non-EVM | second *rail*, different scheme binding | needs a new driver, not a config entry |

**Monad constants (verified 15 Aug 2026, hold for phase 3):**

```jsonc
"eip155:10143": {                       // Monad Testnet
  "explorer": "https://testnet.monadvision.com",
  "facilitator": "https://x402-facilitator.molandak.org",
  "assets": { "USDC": {
    "address": "0x534b2f3A21130d7a60830c2Df862319e593943A3",
    "decimals": 6, "eip712": { "name": "USDC", "version": "2" } } }
},
"eip155:143": {                         // Monad Mainnet
  "explorer": "https://monadvision.com",
  "facilitator": "https://x402-facilitator.molandak.org",
  "assets": { "USDC": {
    "address": "0x754704Bc059F8C67012fEd69BC8A327a5aafb603",
    "decimals": 6, "eip712": { "name": "USDC", "version": "2" } } }
}
```

Monad notes for whenever phase 3 arrives: domain name is `"USDC"`, **not** `"USD Coin"` —
different from most chains, and a silent failure if hardcoded. Requires `@x402/evm ≥ 2.22.0` if
the SDK is ever used; 2.9.0–2.11.0 reference an undeployed Permit2 proxy and fail at settlement
with no clear error. Mainnet launched 24 Nov 2025 with native Circle USDC. Monad Foundation is a
Premier member of the x402 Foundation.

### 2.4 Release gate — what unlocks phase 2

Every box, no exceptions. Multi-network work does not start until this is a tagged `v1.0.0`.

**Correctness**
- [ ] Golden vectors pass — domain, digest, signature, recovered address, full calldata
- [ ] `verify()` passes with the network disabled (I6)
- [ ] Property test: identical key inputs → identical canonical string (I7)
- [ ] Mock driver settles end-to-end with zero core changes (§2.2)

**Safety**
- [ ] Settle on testnet, re-run the identical workflow, get **success** + `AUTH_ALREADY_USED` (I8)
- [ ] Custodial mock driver throws at tier-0 registration (I3)
- [ ] Driver with `nativeReplayProtection: false` refuses to settle (I9)
- [ ] `max_per_payout` blocks before any driver is reached (I10)
- [ ] Kill switch (`settlement.enabled: false`) halts before policy runs

**Supply chain**
- [ ] `npm ls --omit=dev --all` ≤ 2 packages (I11)
- [ ] `dist/` rebuild is byte-identical to committed (I12)
- [ ] Layer-boundary grep is clean (I1)
- [ ] SBOM and build provenance published

**Operational**
- [ ] A real payout settles from an actual PR merge, end to end
- [ ] 20+ consecutive testnet settlements including deliberate replays and expiries
- [ ] A fresh repo integrates in under 5 minutes with zero secrets in dry-run
- [ ] Config schema frozen and published as JSON Schema
- [ ] `v1.0.0` tagged

**The point of the gate:** every unchecked box is a bug you would otherwise discover on a second
chain, where you cannot tell whether it is your bug or the chain's. Fix them where the ground is
firm.

### 2.5 Free test assets

| | Source |
|---|---|
| Ethereum Sepolia USDC | `faucet.circle.com` — select Ethereum Sepolia + USDC |
| Ethereum Sepolia ETH | Google Cloud Web3 faucet, Alchemy, or QuickNode |

Public facilitators are free today with no published SLA. Design for one disappearing — that is
what `mode: self` and `mode: auto` exist for.

## 3. Core types

```ts
// src/core/types.ts — mirrors x402 v2. Do not invent fields.

export interface PaymentRequirements {
  scheme: string;                    // "exact" | "auth-capture" | "upto" | ...
  network: string;                   // CAIP-2: "eip155:143"
  amount: string;                    // atomic units, string — NEVER number
  asset: string;                     // opaque identifier — NOT assumed to be an address
  payTo: string;
  maxTimeoutSeconds: number;
  extra?: Record<string, unknown>;   // e.g. { name: "USDC", version: "2" }
}

export interface PaymentPayload {
  x402Version: 2;
  scheme: string;
  network: string;
  payload: Record<string, unknown>;  // scheme-defined. Core NEVER inspects this.
}

export interface SettlementResponse {
  success: boolean;
  transaction?: string;
  network?: string;
  payer?: string;
  errorReason?: string;
}

// XOps-local
export interface Intent {
  source:
    | { platform: "github"; repo: string; ref: string; actor: string }
    | { platform: "gitlab"; project: string; ref: string; actor: string };
  recipient: string;                 // OPAQUE — resolved, never assumed to be 0x
  amount: string;
  asset: string;
  network: string;
  scheme: string;
  round: number;
}

export interface IdempotencyKey {
  v: 1;
  source: { platform: string; repo: string; ref: string };
  recipient: string;
  asset: string;
  network: string;
  round: number;
  // amount deliberately absent — see AGENTS.md
}

export interface PayoutTarget {
  rail: string;
  address: string;
  attestations?: unknown[];
  resolvedBy: string;
}
```

```ts
// src/drivers/types.ts

export interface Capabilities {
  offlineVerify: boolean;
  needsGas: boolean;
  needsSecret: boolean;
  custodial: boolean;
  nativeReplayProtection: boolean;   // rail enforces exactly-once, or driver must
}

export interface SettlementDriver {
  readonly id: string;               // "exact/eip155"
  readonly capabilities: Capabilities;
  supports(network: string, scheme: string): boolean;
  buildRequirements(intent: Intent): PaymentRequirements;
  verify(p: PaymentPayload, r: PaymentRequirements): Promise<VerifyResult>;
  settle(p: PaymentPayload, r: PaymentRequirements): Promise<SettlementResponse>;
}

export interface VerifyResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  payer?: string;
  reason?: string;                   // an ErrorCode from §6
}
```

**Driver capability matrix:**

| Driver | offlineVerify | needsGas | needsSecret | custodial | nativeReplay | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exact/eip155` (self) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ gas key only | ❌ | ✅ | 0 |
| `facilitator/*` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | **0 — safest default** |
| `auth-capture/eip155` | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | 0 |
| `mock/test` (tests only) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | test |
| any custodial PSP | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | varies | **2 only** |

## 4. Verified EIP-3009 primitives

Source of truth: `x402-min.js` (all assertions passing). Do not reimplement from memory.

**Imports** — note the explicit `.js` extensions, required by noble v2 ESM:

```ts
import { secp256k1 } from "@noble/curves/secp256k1.js";
import { keccak_256 } from "@noble/hashes/sha3.js";
```

**Type hashes** (computed, not copied):

```
EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)
TransferWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)
```

**Digest** = `keccak256( 0x19 || 0x01 || domainSeparator || structHash )`

**Signing** — noble v2 API. The `recovered` format is `[recovery byte][r:32][s:32]`; Ethereum
wants `v = recovery + 27` and a 65-byte `r||s||v`:

```ts
const sig = secp256k1.sign(digest, privKeyBytes, { prehash: false, format: "recovered" });
const v = sig[0] + 27;
const r = sig.subarray(1, 33);
const s = sig.subarray(33, 65);
```

**Recovery** — reproduces exactly what the token contract does on-chain, which is why `verify()`
needs no network:

```ts
const recovered = Buffer.concat([Buffer.from([v - 27]), raw.subarray(0, 64)]);
const sig = secp256k1.Signature.fromBytes(recovered, "recovered");
const pub = sig.recoverPublicKey(digest).toBytes(false).slice(1);  // false = uncompressed
const addr = "0x" + Buffer.from(keccak_256(pub)).subarray(12).toString("hex");
```

> `toBytes()` takes a **boolean** `isCompressed` in noble v2, not the string `"uncompressed"`.
> This is a silent-failure trap.

**Function selector — verified:**

```
transferWithAuthorization(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes32,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)
→ 0xe3ee160e
```

**Calldata layout** — 9 static params, all one 32-byte word, zero dynamic types. Total
**292 bytes** = 4 selector + 9 × 32. No ABI library required:

```
[0:4]     0xe3ee160e
[4:36]    from        (address, left-padded)
[36:68]   to          (address, left-padded)
[68:100]  value       (uint256)
[100:132] validAfter  (uint256)
[132:164] validBefore (uint256)
[164:196] nonce       (bytes32)
[196:228] v           (uint8, left-padded)
[228:260] r           (bytes32)
[260:292] s           (bytes32)
```

**Test vector** (Hardhat account #0 — public, never fund it):

```
privkey  0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
address  0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

Golden-vector files must pin: domain, authorization, digest, signature, recovered address, and
full calldata. Regenerate only deliberately — a diff here means signing changed.

## 5. x402 payload shape

```jsonc
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "eip155:10143",
  "payload": {
    "signature": "0x…65 bytes…",
    "authorization": {
      "from": "0x…",
      "to": "0x…",
      "value": "2500000",
      "validAfter": "1755…",
      "validBefore": "1755…",
      "nonce": "0x…32 bytes…"
    }
  }
}
```

Core never reads inside `payload`. Only `drivers/exact-eip155` does.

---

## 6. Error taxonomy — `src/core/errors.ts`

| Code | Meaning | Comment shown | Retry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_ALREADY_USED` | Nonce consumed | ✅ **Already paid** — link original tx | no |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED` | Past `validBefore` | Re-sign; window is 15 min | user |
| `AUTH_NOT_YET_VALID` | Before `validAfter` | Clock skew — wait 60 s | auto |
| `SIGNER_MISMATCH` | Recovered ≠ expected payer | Wrong wallet connected | user |
| `DOMAIN_MISMATCH` | EIP-712 domain wrong | Check chainId / asset in `.xops.yml` | no |
| `AMOUNT_MISMATCH` | Payload ≠ requirements | Payload was tampered with | no |
| `RECIPIENT_MISMATCH` | Payload `to` ≠ requirements | Payload was tampered with | no |
| `IDENTITY_UNRESOLVED` | No resolver matched | Register a wallet or use inline address | user |
| `POLICY_DENIED` | Gate failed | Which rule, and its value | no |
| `AMOUNT_CAP_EXCEEDED` | Above `max_per_payout` | Cap is N; raise it or split | no |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Treasury short | Fund `0x…`, needs N USDC | user |
| `INSUFFICIENT_GAS` | Gas wallet empty | Fund `0x…` with native token | user |
| `SIMULATION_REVERT` | `eth_call` reverted | Decoded revert reason | no |
| `RPC_UNAVAILABLE` | All endpoints failed | Retryable; set `rpc_url` to override | auto |
| `DRIVER_NOT_FOUND` | No driver for pair | Unsupported network/scheme | no |
| `TIER_VIOLATION` | Driver needs secrets or custody in Tier 0 | Run your own facilitator | no |
| `NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION` | Driver lacks exactly-once guarantee | Cannot settle in Tier 0 | no |

`AUTH_ALREADY_USED` is a **success** path (I8). Everything else in the table is a failure.

---

## 7. Config schema — `.xops.yml`

```yaml
version: 1                          # required; unknown keys warn, never fail

network: eip155:143
scheme: exact
asset: USDC

settlement:
  mode: dry-run                     # dry-run | facilitator | self | auto
  facilitator_url: https://x402-facilitator.molandak.org
  # rpc_url: optional — bundled public endpoints used when omitted
  enabled: true                     # kill switch, honored before policy

policy:
  approvers: [maintainer, admin]
  require: [PR_MERGED, TESTS_PASS, MAINTAINER_APPROVED]
  max_per_payout: "100.00"
  max_per_day: "500.00"

payout:
  round: 0
```

**Policy constants** (named only, never an expression language):
`PR_MERGED` · `TESTS_PASS` · `MAINTAINER_APPROVED` · `COVERAGE_GT_80` ·
`NO_OPEN_REQUESTED_CHANGES` · `SANCTIONS_CLEAR` (optional, no default provider)

Publish a JSON Schema and validate it in CI.

## 8. Adopter-facing workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reward.yml
on:
  issue_comment: { types: [created] }
permissions: { issues: write, pull-requests: write }
jobs:
  pay:
    if: startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/send')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: AOSSIE-Org/xops@v1
```

No `secrets:` block on the default path. Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` inheritance in `workflow_call`
on a scratch repo — if it holds, no PAT is needed for cross-repo callbacks.

**Action outputs, always written including on failure paths:** `TX_HASH`, `EXPLORER_URL`,
`STATUS`, `ERROR_CODE`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`.

## 10. Conformance & CI checks

| Check | Enforces | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Grep `src/core` + `src/adapters` for chain imports and hash primitives | I1 | every push |
| Default config asserts `mode: dry-run` | I5 | every push |
| Verify suite runs with network disabled | I6 | every push |
| Property test: same key inputs → same canonical string | I7 | every push |
| Test: mock driver with `custodial: true` throws at tier-0 registration | I3 | every push |
| Test: driver with `nativeReplayProtection: false` refuses settle | I9 | every push |
| `npm ls --omit=dev --all` package count ≤ 2 | I11 | every push |
| Rebuild `dist/` and diff against committed | I12 | every push |
| Golden vectors match | signing stability | every push |
| `mock/test` driver settles end-to-end with zero core changes | I1 evidence | every push |
| Testnet settle → re-run identical workflow → expect **success** + `AUTH_ALREADY_USED` | I8 | pre-release |
| Fetch x402 spec, regenerate fixtures from published JSON Schemas, run engine | spec drift | weekly cron |

The weekly conformance job is how "don't miss a spec change" becomes true instead of
aspirational — you learn from a red build, not from a blog post.
